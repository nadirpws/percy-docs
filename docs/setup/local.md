# Setup: local development

Percy is designed to integrate with your tests and CI environment, but can also work in local development environments for testing purposes. To enable Percy locally, these environment variables must be configured:

* `PERCY_TOKEN`: The Percy repo write-only API token. This is unique for each Percy repository.
* `PERCY_PROJECT`: The full repository slug, for example `my-org/repo-name`.

When running in your local environment, we also recommend setting the `PERCY_BRANCH` environment variable to local to avoid unintentionally overwriting your project's `master` baseline in Percy.

## Local setup

You can set environment variables locally using `export`:

```bash
$ export PERCY_TOKEN=aaabbbcccdddeeefff
$ export PERCY_PROJECT=my-org/repo-name
$ export PERCY_BRANCH=local
$
$ # Now run your tests locally (just an example, depends on client library used):
$ npm run test
```

Or, all on one line:

```bash
$ PERCY_TOKEN=aaabbbcccdddeeefff PERCY_PROJECT=my-org/repo-name PERCY_BRANCH=local npm run test
```

Careful thoughâ€”if you don't use `PERCY_BRANCH` when you run tests locally, and you are on the `master` branch it will set your project's `master` baseline in Percy.

**IMPORTANT: Keep your Percy token secret.** Anyone with access to your token can consume your account quota, though they cannot read data.
