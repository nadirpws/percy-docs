# Getting started

Percy is designed to integrate with your tests and CI environment. Getting Percy up and running is simple:

**Step 1:** Set the `PERCY_TOKEN` and `PERCY_PROJECT` environment variables in your CI environment.
<br>
**Step 2:** Integrate Percy's client library to take snapshots in tests.
<br>
**Step 3:** Run your tests in CI or create a GitHub PR!
